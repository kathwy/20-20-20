Video Demo (Mac version): https://youtu.be/qkZfuItB52E

A popup app reminding you to rest your eyes every 20 minutes by looking at something 20 ft away for 20 seconds

Both Windows and Mac versions available

WINDOWS:
Important info: The 202020.jar file is the executable for Windows. Make sure that you place the nircmd folder inside this repository in your Program Files directory!

How it works (Windows version): A notification pops up every 20 minutes reminding you about your eye break. Click the eye icon (EYE-CON) to turn off your screen for 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, the screen will automatically turn on again.

MAC:
Important info: Before running the code, you must first install terminal-notifier. Assuming you have Ruby, you can easily install terminal-notifier using gem:  

$ sudo gem install terminal-notifier

How it works (Mac version): A notification pops up every 20 minutes reminding you about your eye break. Another window appears to ask if you would like to take a break. If the answer is yes, the screen will turn off for 20 seconds. If the answer is no, a notification and another window will appear in 10 minutes. "Motivational" messages and GIFs will be displayed for those who say "no."
